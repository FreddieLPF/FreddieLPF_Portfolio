### haphpipe_assemble_01 

This pipeline implements denovo assembly. Reads are first trimmed (trim_reads) and used as input for denovo assembly (assemble_denovo). The denovo assembly stage automatically performs error detection, but trimmed reads are also error corrected (ec_reads). The assembled contigs are used as input for amplicon assembly (assemble_amplicons) along with reference FASTA and GTF files. The assembly is then iteratively refined up to five times (refine_assembly) by mapping corrected reads to the assembled FASTA file and lastly finalized (finalize_assembly), resulting in a FASTA file with final consensus sequences, final VCF, and aligned BAM file.
